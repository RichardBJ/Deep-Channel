##To do in priority order

(**) Give option to save the processed data.
Should be pretty easy! But remember to optionally just save the IDL which will then be input or HJCFIT
(**) Option to allow 1 or two signal reads
...it sort of does, but really it should plot these BEFORE doing the idealisation and then replot after doing it?
(**) Option to do an idealisation or just view the data as is.
(**) Niceties such as a dialogs, to tell you to load a model first etc.... 
(**) The app axis limit buttons dont always agree
(**) More signals?
