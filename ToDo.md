##To do in priority order
(1) The Malab app would be better to infer time etc and just send that to the python script.
(2) Option to allow 1 or two signal reads.
(2) Give option to save the processed data.

(4) Niceties such as a dialogs, to tell you to load a model first etc.... 
(4) More signals?
